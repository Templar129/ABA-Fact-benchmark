You are given one raw JSON file that represents a long natural conversation between two speakers (e.g., Person1 and Person2).

Your task is to:
1. Insert exactly 10 high-quality ABA′ facts into the conversation
2. Preserve the original JSON structure and ordering perfectly
3. Return:
   - a fully modified, valid JSON file with the ABA′ facts inserted
   - a structured list describing the 10 inserted ABA′ facts

This task is for dataset construction, not creative writing.
Correctness, realism, and structural integrity are mandatory.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 0 — JSON DATA STRUCTURE (CRITICAL)

Before making any changes, you must inspect and understand the original JSON structure.

0.1 Assumed Structure

The JSON contains conversation samples. Each conversation contains a dialogue list.
Each dialogue entry has:
- a unique dia_id
- a speaker field
- a text field
dia_id values represent strict temporal order from top to bottom.

Example (illustrative only):

{
  "sample_id": "conv_XX",
  "conversation": [
    {
      "dia_id": "D1:1",
      "speaker": "Person1",
      "text": "..."
    }
  ]
}

Your actual file may contain additional fields. Do NOT remove or rename them.

------------------------------------------------------------
0.2 Structural Invariants (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS)

- No existing dialogue entry may be deleted or modified
- All inserted entries must follow the same schema
- dia_id ordering must remain strictly increasing
- No duplicated dia_id
- No missing dia_id
- No reordering of existing dialogue
- No changes to sample_id or nesting

If dia_id values are numeric or incremental, generate new dia_id values that:
- fit the existing format exactly
- preserve strict ordering

If dia_id values are strings, follow the same naming logic.

If the dia_id pattern cannot be inferred reliably, STOP and infer it first.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 1 — WHAT ABA′ FACTS ARE

An ABA′ fact is a structured contradiction pattern unfolding over time:

A: Initial factual claim by Person1
B: Later claim by Person1 that contradicts or revises A
A′: Later claim by Person1 that returns to A (exactly or semantically)

This is not repetition.
It is a temporal belief inconsistency followed by recovery.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 2 — REQUIRED STRUCTURE FOR EACH ABA′ FACT

Each of the 10 ABA′ facts must satisfy ALL conditions.

2.1 Sentence-Level Structure

Each ABA′ fact must contain at least 6 new dialogue entries, forming 3 pairs:

1. Person1 states A
2. Person2 responds naturally
3. Person1 states B
4. Person2 responds naturally (different style)
5. Person1 states A′
6. Person2 responds naturally again (non-identical)

------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Placement Constraints

- The three pairs must not be adjacent
- Each pair must be separated by unrelated dialogue
- Temporal order must be A → B → A′
- Insertions must respect dia_id ordering

------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 Speaker Constraints

- Only Person1 introduces A, B, and A′
- Person2 never states the fact
- Person2 responses must vary (agreement, hesitation, curiosity, mild challenge)

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 3 — NATURALNESS AND CONTEXTUAL FIT

Inserted dialogue must:
- Sound like ordinary daily conversation
- Be locally coherent with surrounding turns
- Flow naturally before and after insertion
- Avoid meta-language or synthetic tone

The conversation should read as if the ABA′ facts were always present.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 4 — FACT DESIGN CONSTRAINTS

- All 10 ABA′ facts must be mutually distinct
- Must not overlap with existing facts
- Must not overlap with each other

Avoid reusing:
- same activity
- same habit
- same object
- same domain

Prefer diverse domains:
- routines
- preferences
- ownership
- scheduling
- constraints
- personal experiences

Avoid dramatic events or implausible reversals.

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 5 — INSERTION RULES (STRICT)

- Do NOT rewrite existing dialogue
- Only insert new dialogue objects
- Preserve original ordering
- Every inserted object must:
  - follow the original schema
  - include a valid dia_id

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 6 — REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

6.1 Output 1 — Modified JSON

- Output the entire modified JSON
- Must be valid and complete
- Directly downloadable
- No explanations inside JSON

------------------------------------------------------------
6.2 Output 2 — ABA′ Fact Index

After the JSON, provide a structured list.

For each fact (Fact1–Fact10), include:
- Fact ID
- A statement (verbatim)
- B statement (verbatim)
- A′ statement (verbatim)
- dia_id for A, B, and A′

Example:

Fact 4:
A  (dia_id: D1:18): "..."
B  (dia_id: D1:41): "..."
A′ (dia_id: D1:67): "..."

------------------------------------------------------------
PART 7 — QUALITY PRIORITY

If you must choose between speed and correctness, always choose correctness.

This dataset is intended for long-term memory consistency evaluation.

------------------------------------------------------------
Begin by:
1. Reading the full JSON
2. Understanding dia_id progression
3. Planning insert locations
4. Performing insertions
5. Verifying structure
6. Outputting results
